This program simulates an airport with 2 runways.
One plane can only land and the other can only depart in each unit of time.
Up to what number of planes can be waiting to land or take off at any time?How many units of time will the simulation run?Expected number of arrivals per unit time?Expected number of departures per unit time?Plane number 0 ready to land.
